# Getting Started with Static Sites

Static site generators are a great way to build fast, secure websites. Here's why I love them:

## Benefits

1. **Speed** - No database queries, just static HTML
2. **Security** - No server-side code means fewer vulnerabilities
3. **Simplicity** - Write in Markdown, deploy anywhere
4. **Cost** - Host for free on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel

## Getting Started

With Minuto, you can get started in minutes:

```bash
npx minuto init my-blog --template blog
cd my-blog
npm run dev
```

That's it! You have a fully functional blog ready to customize.
