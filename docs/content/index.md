Minuto (Italian for "small, minute") is designed to get your static site up and running in minutes, not hours. It includes everything you need out of the box and it still maintains its size super small:

- No complex configuration required
- Tailwind CSS pre-configured
- Development server with live reload
- Production-ready builds
- Clean, semantic HTML output
